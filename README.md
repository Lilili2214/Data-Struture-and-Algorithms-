# Data-Struture-and-Algorithms-

This repository contains a collection of projects practicing skills and knowledge in Data Structure and Algorithms from basic to advanced levels.



## Greedy Algorithms

The Greedy Algorithms project focuses on implementing various greedy algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, Prim's algorithm, and Kruskal's algorithm in Python. These algorithms are used to find the minimum spanning tree, shortest path, and other optimization problems.

## Stack

The Stack project demonstrates the implementation of a stack data structure in Python. It includes basic stack operations such as push, pop, and peek, as well as applications of stacks such as evaluating postfix expressions and solving problems like balanced parentheses.

## Queue

The Queue project explores the implementation of a queue data structure in Python. It covers queue operations like enqueue and dequeue, as well as applications of queues such as breadth-first search (BFS) traversal of a graph and solving problems like resource scheduling.

## Linked List

The Linked List project focuses on implementing various types of linked lists such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists in Python. It covers operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal, as well as applications of linked lists such as representing polynomial expressions and solving problems like reversing a linked list.

## Graph

The Graph project demonstrates the implementation of graph data structures and algorithms in Python. It covers graph representation using adjacency lists or matrices, graph traversal algorithms like depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS), and graph algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm and Prim's algorithm.

## Rabin-Karp Algorithm

The Rabin-Karp Algorithm project implements the Rabin-Karp algorithm for string searching and pattern matching in Python. This algorithm is used to find occurrences of a pattern within a text string efficiently by hashing substrings and comparing hashes.
